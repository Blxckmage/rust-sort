# Rust Sorting Algorithms

This is my personal project where I have implemented various sorting algorithms in the Rust programming language.

- Bubble sort
- Bucket sort
- Heap sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort (unstable result, might fix later)
- Selection sort
- Merge sort

You can find the code for these algorithms in the `src/sorting` directory. I have also included a benchmark in src/main.rs, which you can run using `cargo run`.
